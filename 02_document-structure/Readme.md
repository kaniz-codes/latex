## Document Structure in LaTeX

### What I learned:
- The basic skeleton of a LaTeX document uses `\documentclass{}` (e.g., `article`, `report`, `book`) to define the type.
- The main content is enclosed within `\begin{document}` and `\end{document}`.
- Organized content using `\section{}`, `\subsection{}`, and `\subsubsection{}`.
- Add comments with `%`.

### Commands practiced:
- `\documentclass{article}`
- `\title{...}`
- `\author{...}`
- `\date{...}`
- `\maketitle`
- `\section{...}`, `\subsection{...}`, `\subsubsection{...}`
- `%` for comments

## 1. article Class
Used for short documents: papers, articles, assignments, etc.

check out file article.txt for formate.
