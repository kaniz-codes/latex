# LaTeX: The Best Document Preparation System

In this repository, I will be exploring **LaTeX**, a powerful typesetting system widely used for creating professional and structured documents, especially in academic and scientific writing.

To make things easy, I will use **Overleaf**, an online LaTeX editor that runs entirely in the browser—no installation required.

## Getting Started with Overleaf

Using LaTeX through Overleaf is straightforward:

1. Go to [https://overleaf.com](https://overleaf.com)
2. Click on **"Log In"** (or **"Register"** if you don’t have an account).
3. Once you're logged in, click **"New Project"** and choose **"Blank Project"** to start writing LaTeX code immediately.


> Overleaf automatically compiles your `.tex` file into a PDF as you write—no need to install anything on your local system.
